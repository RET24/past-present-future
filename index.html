<h2>Past</h2>
<p>I was born in a little town called America, im joking. I was born in <a href="http://www.greenvillesc.gov/" target="_blank">Greenville South Carolina</a>, May 4th, 2003. I Lived in greenville since I was born and still currently do. Greenville is a nice place filled with some good people doing nice things.
 I did/do a lot of things in greenville, like ride my first rollercoaster and go carts. Most of my family live in South Carolina, and some in other states, None of them live out side the united states, well none that I know of.

<h2>Present</h2>
<p>I live in a house with my mom and dad, and 4 siblings. I am the second oldest out of the kids, my oldest brother is 17, and 3 years ahead of me.
my younger brother is 1 year younger than me and he is 13 years old. My two little sisters and both younger, one 2 years behind me and one 6 years behind.
So thats makes me 14. Some fun things that I like to do is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp" target="_blank">Code</a>, and play games, and basketball. that is only some of them.</p>

<p> I like to do coding because I enjoy making webpages and things like that, and it could benefit me in the futrue. I think a lot of people like to play games, even if it's a small one on their phones. One of my favorite games is <a href="http://en.tankiforum.com/" target="_blank">Tanki Online</a>.
 I play Tanki kind of a lot because I think it's fun. A sport that I play is basketball, I like to play football too, but I play basketball more often. I play it with my older brother, and I play the sport, Just not that good at it. When me and my brother 1v1 I Lose, <b>BUT</b> not always.</p>




<h2>Future</h2>
<p>When I graduate highschool, I plan to go to collage, Im just not sure which one though. My dream job is to be a <a href="http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/automobile-engineering/1/353575.html" target="_blank">AutoMoblie Engineer</a> or ethier a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm" target="_blank">computer software devloper</a>.
I might end up changing one of them because of "Some Reasons". I don't plan to live south carolina, mainly because I don't like to travel long distances. I also Plan to get a good grade on this project, and make my grades better. I want a good job when I get a little older, and graduate collage,whenever I get in to one. I don't know what else I plan to do, but untill I do that is all.</p>
